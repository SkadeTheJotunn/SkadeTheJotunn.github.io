      <li><strong>Odin or Woden:</strong> The ruler/leader of the Aesir. He is very cunning and has made many sacrifices to gain knowledge. He once hung himself from a tree for nine days to learn how to read the runes (words that can cast spells). He gives his name to Wednesday, or Woden's Day.</li>
      <li><strong>Thor or Porr:</strong> The god of thunder and the son of Odin. He has a hammer, Mjolnir, in which he uses to kill frost giants. His name is the origin of Thursday.</li>
      <li><strong>Loki:</strong> The adopted brother of Odin who is half frost giant. He causes much trouble for the Aesir and has to help them out of trouble, both of his making and of theirs.</li>
