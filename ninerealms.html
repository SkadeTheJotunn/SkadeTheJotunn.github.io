  <div class="centered"><h1>THE NINE REALMS</h1></div>
  
  <p>The nine realms are the different worlds of Norse Mythology that are connected by the world tree, Yggdrasil. With a total of nine, the worlds are Asgard, Midgard, Alfheim, Vanaheim (my personal favorite), Niflheim, Muspelheim, Jotunheim, Svartalfheim (or sometimes Nidavellir), and finally Helheim.</p>

    <h2>Asgard</h2>
    <p>Asgard is the realm of the Aesir gods. Heimdall, the gate keeper, guards the Bifrost that connects Asgard to the other realms. Here, in Asgard, each of the Aesir have a hall in which they dwell. Odinn's is very special because, as the king, he has a throne that when he sits upon it, he can see throughput all the realms. Once, when Frey was looking for Freya, he sat upon the throne, but, rather than finding Freya, he saw the beautiful Gerd. Also, this is the realm where Valhalla is located. Valhalla is the Norse's version of warrior heaven. Valkyries sitting upon winged horses would carry the soul's of brave soldiers into Odinn's Valhalla where they would train for an eternity as they awaited the end battle of Ragnarok.</p>

    <h2>Vanaheim</h2>
    <p>Vanaheim is the realm of the Vanir gods, and its description reflects what they are associated with. It is protrayed as much more peaceful and more wild, contrasting the warrior halls of Asgard. Here, Freya hosts Folkvanger, the Vanir heaven. Fow while Odinn and his valkyries pick warriors, so does Freya, and they too prepare for Ragnarok.</p>
