  <div class="centered"><h1>AESIR AND VANIR</h1></div>
  <center><p>The Aesir and the Vanir are the two primary tribes of gods and goddesses. After the Aesir defeated Ymir and created the world, a strange visitor came to their realm of beauty and power. They discovered that the visitor was a witch and they tried to burn her, but they found that she wouldn't die. When she got the chance, she ran away and informed the Vanir of what had been done to her (she is believed to be part of the Vanir, possibly a disguised Freyja). This angered the Vanir, and a war was aged between the two tribes. After centuries of fighting, they began to realize that neither could be defeated since they were all gods and held lots of power. To declare peace, the two exchanged hostages. The Vanir gave Njord, and with him came is twin children, Frey and Freyja. The Aesir have Mimir and Hoenir. Hoenir was a good speaker, so the Vanir listened to him. Mimir, was very smart, so Mimir had been the one telling Hoenir what to say. When the Vanir learned of this, they were very mad, so they chopped off Mimir's head and sent it to Odin. Mimir was a friend of Odin's, so he tried to save his friend by placing him in the well of knowldege. He survived and became the guardian of the well. Meanwhile, (somehow) peace prevailed and the two tribes lived in peace with one another.</p></center>

    <h2>Odin or Woden</h2>
    <p>The ruler/leader of the Aesir. He is very cunning and has made many sacrifices to gain knowledge. He once hung himself from a tree for nine days to learn how to read the runes (words that can cast spells). Sometimes, he visits Midgard disguised (most often) as an old man. He gives his name to Wednesday, or Woden's Day.</p>

    <h2>Thor or Porr</h2>
    <p>The god of thunder and the son of Odin. He has a hammer, Mjolnir, in which he uses to kill frost giants. He is known for having a short-temper. Him and Loki tend to work together, but sometimes, when Loki works his mischief, they are enemies. His name is the origin of Thursday.</p></center>

    <center><h2>Loki</h2>
    <p>The adopted brother of Odin who is half frost giant. He causes much trouble for the Aesir and has to help them out of trouble, both of his making and of theirs. At one point, he comes up with a plan to kill Balder, and when it happens, he is caught and chained under the mouth of a serpent, and his freedom marks the start of Ragnarok.</p>

    <h2>Heimdall or Heimdallr</h2>
    <p>He is the gatekeeper of the gods. He guards the entrance to Asgard and the rainbow bridge that connects Midgard and Asgard (see <a href="./ninerealms.html">The Nine Realms</a>). Also, he is associated with establishing the three social classes in the Norse world. When Ragnarok comes, he will blow his horn to signal that it has started.</p></center>

<h2>Aesir</h2> <p><a href="./practice.html">The Nine Realms></a></p>
  <p>These are the best-known of the gods and are associated most commonly with war. They live in the realm of Asgard.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Frigg or Frigga:</strong> She is the queen of the Aesir and Odin's favorite wife. She knows much of the future but doesn't tell anyone what she knows. She is associated with love and marriage and gives her name to Friday.</li>
      <li><strong>Tyr:</strong> He is the bravest of the gods. He once placed his hand in the mouth of Fenrir (or Fenris) so that Fenrir could be bound. Fenrir then bit Tyr's hand off. His mother is a goddess and married to a frost giant. His name is associtaed with Tuesday. </li>
      <li><strong>Balder or Baldur:</strong> He is the shining god and he is loved by all, supposedly. When Frigg heard that he would be killed, she asked everything to not hurt him, except for Mistletoe. Loki heard of this and made a mistletoe dart and tricked Hod (Balder's blind brother) into throwing it at Balder, killing him.</li>
      <li><strong>Sif:</strong> She is the wife of Thor and is best known for having the most beautiful golden hair. It was cut off by Loki and replaced with a dwarven-made wig of real, golden (and I mean <em>gold</em>) hair. She is also said to be the Aesir goddess of grain.</li>
      <li><strong>Idunn:</strong> She is the goddess of youth and guards the golden apples that the Aesir eat to remain youthful. Once, Loki was used by a giant to trick Idunn into being taken by a frost giant. While she was gone, the Aesir grew old, and so, Loki had to once again, get them out of trouble and bring back Idunn and her golden apples. I have seen her depcited as a Vanir goddess, but it is very rare.</li>
      <li><strong>Bragi:</strong> He is the god of poetry. It is possible that Bragi may have been an actual man because some of the oldest Norse poets we know of was named "Bragi the Old." Bragi is married to Idunn because Odin thought that the poet should have the goddess of youth, saying it was only fitting.</li>
      <li><strong>Balder or Baldr:</strong> As the god of light and purity, Balder prized among all the Aesir, but this fame gets him into trouble when Loki gets jealous. Frigg begins to get nightmares of her beloved Balder dying, and so she runs through all the worlds, asking all creatures and thing to ptomise to not hurt Balder, and she is able to extract that promise from all, except for the little mistletoe which was overlooked by her desperate eye. Loki learned of this and gave Balder's blind brother a mistletoe dart to throw at Balder while the other gods and anjoying the game since nothing is supposed to hurt him. However, when the dart hits him, he is killed and Ragnarok is said to begin soon after.</li>
      <li><strong>Hod or Hodr:</strong> He is Balder's bling brother and is set up by Loki into killing his beloved brother. He is then killed in hopes of avenging Balder.
      <li><strong>Nanna:</strong> As Balder's wife, she is very kind and sweet. She and her husband are faithful to one another, and when she hears of his death she is greatly distraught. At Balder's funeral, she dies and is sent on the same funeral ship.</li>
      <li><strong>Forseti:</strong> The son of Balder and Nanna. He is considered the most fair and just among the gods and he becomes a sort of judge among the gods and creatures of the nine realms. People come to him to settle disputes.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Vanir</h2>
  <p>The Vanir live in Vanaheim and are most commonly associated with natural forces. Some of them are common visitors of Asgard.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Frey or Freyr:</strong> As the twin brother of Freya (or Freyja), he is the god of fertility, sun, and rain. He is sometimes protrayed as a ruthless war-lord, while other times he is associated with peace. He is the son of Njord. He is sometimes invited to join the council of the Aesir and that is how he got is golden-bristled boar. One tale about hime involves that giantess Gerd. He sat upon Odin's throne that could see everything, looking for his sister, but instead he saw the most beautiful giantess maiden and he instantly fell in love. He sent his servant to fetch her, but he had to give up his sword. Without his sword, it meant his ultimate demise at Ragnarok. He gave it up, and after waiting 9 long days, he met with the giantess and he melted her icey heart and they were married. </li>
    <li><strong>Freya or Freyja:</strong> She is the twin sister of Frey and is also the goddess of fertility. She is also often considered the goddess of love. She is known for having a chariot that is pulled by cats and having an undying desire for gold. She is the ruler of the heaven in Vanaheim, the Aesir have Valhalla and the Vanir have Folkvangr.</li>
    <li><strong>Njord:</strong> He is the god of the sea and ocean. He is important because the Norse used the water to travel when they went on their raids. He is also the god of fishing, but surprisingly, Loki is known for inventing the net.</li>
    <li><strong>Ullr:</strong> As the son of Sif and stepson of Thor, I found it to be quite surprising to seem him portrayed as part of the Vanir, but his association with hunting and winter makes it clear why. He is considered to be the best archerer and he can be often found hunting in the woods.</li> 
    <li><strong>Kvasir</strong> He is considered the god of knowledge. After the Aesir-Vanir War, the two tribes exchanged hostages and each side took turns spitting into a vat. From that vat, Kvasir rose, with the knowledge of both the Aesir and Vanir. However, other creatures wanted this knowledge, and he was killed by two dwarves. They took his blood and turned it into the mead of knowledge/poetry. Odin heard of this and grabbed it, disguised as a hawk. As he travelled back to Asgard with the mead, some of it spilled and fell onto Midgard, and it is said that poets were splashed with that mead.</li>
    <li><strong>Od or Odr:</strong> As the husband and lover of Freyja, he disappeared one day when Freyja went out in search of a golden necklace. Little is known about him other than he disappeared and from that day, Freyja weeps and searches for him. Her tears are gold and considered very valuable. When Frey was looking for Freyja and sat upon Odin's throne, Freyja had been searching for Od.</li>
    <li><strong>Hnoss and Gersemi:</strong> These two are the daughters of Freyja and Od, and both are named after gold. It is believed that Hnoss will be the one to bring her mother and father back together.</li>
  </div>
  <h2>Other Deities</h2>
  <p>While some of the Aesir and Vanir stated above could be listed here or in the opposite tribe, I think the catagories I placed them in were the ones that appeared most commonly. This list is of other gods and goddesses that weren't neccesarily Aesir or Vanir.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Skade or Skadi:</strong> Goddess of skiing, hunting, and winter like Ullr. She is of jotunn origin and came to Asgrad because she was seeking compensation for her father's death. When she arrived, she agreed that if she got to choose a husband and if they could make her laugh, she would be satisfied. She wanted Balder (or Baldr), and since the Aesir didn't want to lose him, they made Skade choose by only being able to look at the god's feet. She chose what she believed to be the cleanest feet, but when the god was revealed, it turned out to be Njord, god of the sea, because his feet were clean from the ocean. Their marriage didn't work out, despite their mutual liking of one another. Skade wanted to live in the mountains since they were her home, and Njord longed to live by the sea. They ended up living seperately.</li>
    <li><strong>Aegir:</strong> He is also a god of the sea, however, he is still considered a Jotunn. Similar to Greek Mythology, after the Aesir defeated Ymir, some of the jotunns that ruled over certain aspects of the world retained their power, like how the Olympians defeated Kronus and other titans, but some of the other titans still held power. A story about Aegir starts with the gods wishing to feast inside his hall, but he didn't want to host a feast for the blundering gods. He came up with a way to try and stop them, he told the gods that they would have to get the biggest pot so that he could make enough mead and food for ravenous gods. They agreed. Tyr said that his mother's husband, his stepfather, owned a pot that matched this description, so Thor and Tyr set out in search of this pot. Before he could get the pot, the Jotunn made Thor come fishing with him. Thor, using a boar's head as bait, caught the world-serpent from the depths of the seas, but released him back into the ocean. The two came back to land, Thor now hoping to gain the pot. However, the Jotunn said that in order to get it, he had to break his unbreakable goblet. But Tyr's mother knew how to do it. The jotunn's skull was harder than the goblet, so Thor smashed the goblet on the jotunn's head and left with the pot. Aegir served the gods a feast and brewed the best mead.</li>
    <li><strong>Ran:</strong> She is the wife of Aegir and rules the seas alongside him. She is associated with death at sea. It is known that she may drag you under the water into your watery grave. Also, when sailors die at sea, instead of being sent to Helheim, Valhalla, or Folkvangr, their souls are forever trapped in Ran's netted skirts.</li>
    <li><strong>Hela:</strong> As the daughter of Loki and the giantess, Angrboda, she was banished to rule over the world of the dead. When creatures die, their souls are sent to the land of the dead if they aren't deemed worthy of Valhalla or Folkvangr or trapped in the nets of Ran.</li>
